package com.xys.cenxi.ext.print;


/*

de.kupzog.ktools.kprint*  Version 1.1
_______________________________________________________________________

This is the source of a print layout package for Java SWT applications.
The features in short terms:

- creating well layouted printed documents by putting image and text 
  boxes on a document
  
- printing swt tables and ktables (see de.kupzog.ktable) within this framework 

- a page setup dialog (sorry, only in german)

- a print preview dialog (sorry, also only in german)
  
  
For a detailed function description refer to the api documentation that 
is included in the sourcefiles. For examples how to use KPrint, see the 
de.kupzog.ktools.kprint.example package.


Known problems:
_______________________________________________________________________

- Oversized images and tables will be printed over the margins
  (but not over the page border)
  
- No bold/italic words within other words in a text box available
  (only the complete box can be bold)
  
- The Print Preview can differ from the printed document (slightly
  different page breakes). This is because the space occupied by text
  changes with the font resolution. You can observe this phenomenon 
  also in some cases by changing the preview size.
